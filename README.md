At the overview stage, we can see the following: <br />
_ Maximum game is 85, which represents the past while the modern NBA only has 82 games. However, the 3 games difference in total does not contribute significantly, it's the playing style of the whole league in general. <br />
_ net_rating ranges from -200 to 300, which means there is a need for data preparation here. <br />
_ From the csv, draft_year ranges from 1963 to 2019 with major year gaps in between. This means we have up to latest data about current players while there are significant amount of players not being represented <br /> <br />

After graphing, the following is obversed: <br />
_ Weight are ever-increasing. This may due to better meal and science-built body training to maximize physical tools for athletes. <br />

<h2> This may indicate that drafting numbers and drafting rounds are not based on current level of performance but based on potential prospect. </h2>

<br />

<h2> This also represents the drafting quality of each class, which shows a surplus to standard in overall or injury plague among top drafted players. </h2> 
For example, in the top 10 drafted players of the 2010 NBA draft class, only <b>John Wall</b> and Cousins averaging over 10 points a game, while other future All-Stars like <b>Paul George</b> or <b>Gordon Hayward</b> averaging 7.8 points and 5.4 points a game, which didn't provide much of an impact for their teams.
<br />
    
<b>In general </b>, over the years, net rating has a strong negative correlation with draft number. This shows the <b>increasingly accurate</b> of scouting in the NBA.

<br />
<b>The lower</b> the draft numbers, <b>the higher accuracy</b> of scouting and <b>the more distinction</b> between higher drafted players and lower drafted ones.
    
<br />
<b>Lower PLUS_MINUS</b> here means <b>better performed players were in weaker teams</b> in the league, which negatively impacts players' plus_minus, while other guys have minimal impact.
