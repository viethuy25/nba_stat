At the overview stage, we can see the following: <br />
_ Maximum game is 85, which represents the past while the modern NBA only has 82 games. However, the 3 games difference in total does not contribute significantly, it's the playing style of the whole league in general. <br />
_ net_rating ranges from -200 to 300, which means there is a need for data preparation here. <br />
_ From the csv, draft_year ranges from 1963 to 2019 with major year gaps in between. This means we have up to latest data about current players while there are significant amount of players not being represented <br /> <br />

After graphing, the following is obversed: <br />
_ Weight are ever-increasing. This may due to better meal and science-built body training to maximize physical tools for athletes. <br />
_ Usage rate is higher linked with points and assists than rebounds. <br />
_ There are no correlation between points, asssists or rebounds with draft number and draft rounds. <br />

<h2> This means drafting numbers and drafting rounds are not based on current level of performance but based on potential prospect. </h2>

<br /><br />

<h2>However </h2>, net ratings of higher drafted numbers and drafted rounds are getting more correlated as time goes by. It proves that <h2>scout accuracy are getting better.</h2>
